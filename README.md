# Uber Data Modeling Project

This project demonstrates the process of converting a fact table of Uber ride data into dimension tables. The fact table contains data about Uber rides, including the customer pick-up and drop-off details, the timing, the destination, the price, and the tax. The dimension tables are:

Customer dimension table: Contains information about each customer, such as the customer name, address, and phone number.
Ride dimension table: Contains information about each ride, such as the ride ID, the pick-up location, the drop-off location, the start time, and the end time.
Time dimension table: Contains information about each time, such as the day, the month, the year, and the day of the week
